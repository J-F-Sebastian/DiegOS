\chapter{Foreword}
\section*{Inheritance and other inspirations}
I approached the world of computing when I was 8 years old.
Back at the time information technology was seen as the future and was
represented as a kind of magic, something that could not be understood but
rather revealed or discovered.
Lots of movies used computer science as a subject to create stunning stories
where young guys (just like me!) experienced unbelievable adventures after
discovering new hidden powers while hacking stuff; not to mention the fact
that most of the offices seen in movies were filled with computers, no matter
what they could be used for, they were giving answers: finding clues, finding
people, finding informations.
Remeber \textit{tron} or \textit{war games} ? Here it goes.

My father bought a Commodore C64 after an intensive and extensive search throughout most of the electronics shops
available, probably inspired by the passion I demonstrated for computers.

He had a target --- having me and my brother understand what a computer could
do --- but it was only partially met: I went on to become an engineer,
my brother chose a different path.\footnote{He is a doctor now.}

I still remember my joy and my interest when I found out there was more than
a BASIC interpreter in that machine.
I wondered how developers could code games or applications by using such a
simple language, so I tried myself writing code for simple programs writing
text to screen; I was constantly running out of memory, or waiting eons for the data cassette
to read in data, and getting frustrated as I could not understand "the magic"
behind the scene.
But then one day a friend of mine paid a visit to me and lent me a fabulous
gadget: a cartridge running a Pascal compiler, along with a technical manual
covering the C64 internals and the assembler for the processor and the sprites
technology... and lots more.
Then I turned 15 when I asked for a more powerful computer: my intense desire was
to explore the unknown universe of the then innovative AMIGA
platform, but to have access to that machine, I'd had to explain to my father my
reasons and also provide him with a good reason to spend his money. I failed,
because to his eyes the Commodore machines were merely gaming machines, not serious
pieces of hardware, so I had to switch to a backup plan.

I focused on another prominent platform, born in the silicon valley as well
but looking very different.
I succeded in replacing my beloved C64 with an i8086-based personal computer running
MS-DOS version 3.3 (\textbf{yes}, version 3.3 !)
and from then on I got more and more interested in two aspects of computing:
transmitting data and having software interact with hardware.

I succeded in replacing my beloved C64 with an i8086-based personal computer
running MS-DOS version 3.3 (\textbf{yes}, version 3.3 !)
and from then on I got more and more interested in two aspects of computing:
transmitting data and having software interact with hardware.
I approached Intel assembler, way more complicated than 6510, and then structured
procedural programming by learning Pascal.
Next came the C language, then Delphi, then 3D programming, in a never ending
spiral of learning, trying, and looking for new challenges.

While attending university I fell in love with operating systems.
This interest eventually led me to try to write an operating system by myself.
Developing a full-blown operating system as a spare time activity proved to be
really challenging. There are way too much
OS in the world let's be honest, it is not worth the effort to add a new one
just for the sake of it.
As a student I simply put aside this project, and focused on more interesting
distractions.\footnote{You might guess what could possibly distract a 25 years 
old man from spending nights in front of a computer.}
But as a professional software developer I approached the embedded systems
universe and I found an interesting niche to work on.
This is why I resumed my late OS project and wrote DiegOS.

From my personal standpoint the main goal of an Operating System is to offer a 
friendly and comfortable environment for both programmers, users, and administrators,
or in other words, offer an effective interface to the underlying hardware.
Scoring this goal is not easy: since the very first Operating System inception, a huge number of engineers 
and scientists worked to develope concepts, ideas, architectures, interfaces, and documenting 
their work to produce what we know today as Microsoft Windows, Linux, Unix, or Apple Inc. macOS.
All these people proved to be smarter than the Author of this book, no need to
argue upon it.

Up today I had the chance and the privilege to work on a number of Operating Systems,
some of them with peculiar features, some of them with legacy constraints, most of
them with a clear design.
DiegOS was born after years of careful and intensive meditation; it has no peculiarities,
a KISS \footnote{The acronim stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid.} approach, no legacy constraints, and above all a humble
target: do the right thing, the easy way, the fastest way, avoiding common errors and nuisances.

Development of DiegOS took a lot of my spare time, still I did not conceive all the contents of this book by myself;
the most inspiring source of wisdom at the heart of DiegOS is Minix. 
Minix is definitively a fitness room, furnished with all the whistles and bells and tools you could ever dream of.
This \textbf{\emph{does not imply}} that Minix is the best Operating System out there, 
it simply means I consider it a delightful piece of code.

Besides, the most inspiring source to improve my programming skills was
Michael Abrash's \emph{Graphics Programming Black Book};
all I have to say about it is, zenning is a very long journey, and you'd better take your time and read it.

Last but not least, writing software requires patience. Resilience to failure. Acceptance of personal limits.
Acknowledge of success when new code runs the way it should. Fighting anger
and frustration when things just don't go.
Understanding of the true nature of software: vacuity. Because all software of any kind under any form is
essentially an abstract algorithm performing elementary actions faster than
our mind could.
The creator of all software \textbf{is} our mind, but \textbf{no software can replace} our mind.

Still they both are ephemeral, abstract.
I leave to the reader an abstract taken from \quote{The Sutra of the Heart},
my favourite lecture when in need of wiseness.

Enjoy my book, I hope you will enjoy my software.

\newpage

\emph{" Form is empty, emptiness is form, Emptiness is not other than form, form is also not other than emptiness.
Likewise, sensation, discrimination, conditioning, and awareness are empty.}

\emph{In this way, Sariputra, all things are emptiness; they are without defining characteristics; they are not born, they do not cease, they are not defiled, they are not undefiled. They have no increase, they have no decrease.}

\emph{Therefore, Sariputra, in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, no discrimination, no conditioning, and no awareness. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. There is no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no texture, no phenomenon. There is no eye-element and so on up to no mind-element and also up to no element of mental awareness. There is no ignorance and no elimination of ignorance and so on up to no aging and death and no elimination of aging and death. Likewise, there is no suffering, origin, cessation, or path; there is no wisdom, no attainment, and even no non-attainment.''}

\chapter{Architecture}
\section{Design}
DiegOS has been designed to be a simple application running on top of bare metal.
It is compiled and linked as a single binary image, a single process application able to run 
concurrent threads of execution by means of a co-operative scheduler.
The software is partitioned in layers with defined dependencies between modules;
DiegOS does not support multiple processors,  multiple cores, or multiple hardware 
threads of execution; it does not offer memory protection or swappable memory,
and does not offer preemption.
This kind of design is not innovative, it resembles most embedded OS available
online, or what are commonly known as realtime OS.

The hardware abstration is implemented with a well defined virtual interface
which is to be implemented for any platform and any processor.
DiegOS is designed to be configurable, and the first confguration step is
the definition of a tuple (processor, platform) which instructs the code and
the compiler on what to do with very specific aspects of the hardware, like
context switching or interrupt handling.

\subsection{Overview}
Using a bottom-up perspective the system is split into 3 layers

\begin{enumerate}
\item kernel layer composed by the kernel and the drivers
\item libraries layer composed by libraries
\item application layer composed by user space code
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{diegos_layers}
\end{figure}

the \textbf{kernel} is composed of several items like a mutex manager to coordinate
concurrency between threads, an alarm manager to implement timers, an event manager
to exchange messages between threads, barriers, spin locks, I/O support for drivers.
The inner part of the core is all about thread management and is not directly exposed
to other modules, a specific kernel API is provided to access these components
from applications.

Along with the \textbf{kernel} come the \textbf{drivers} which --- as the name
implies --- are modules with a well-defined interface used to drive hardware
devices. They are sensitive and prone to fatal errors and need to mess with
interrupts. They are logically next to the kernel as they both belong to the
first abstraction stage, from hardware to software.

The middle layer is occupied by \textbf{libraries}, any kind of API or utility
which can be used by both the kernel and the applications.
They are logically above the first layer as they abstract algorithms and data
structures from raw memory, file access, network connections.
In a more restrictive design the kernel would never share code or data with
applications, and this was the starting point also for DiegOS, until it became
clear that code was bloating and memory footprint was growing due to duplication
in kernel and library codebases. In order to avoid these situations a compromise
was decided, share code but not data.

The top layer is occupied by \textbf{applications} which are the actual
portion of the code written by developers to do something useful. Although
\textit{applications} recalls user space processes there is no concept of user and 
kernel space in DiegOS, applications are just code linked to the OS but using the 
APIs offered by the kernel and the libraries.
Still, applications are not allowed to call the kernel's internals directly.

\subsection{Layer 1: The kernel}
Going a bit deeper into details, the \textbf{kernel} is composed by 4 specific
items: the \textbf{scheduler}, the \textbf{system clock manager}, the
\textbf{kernel interface} and the \textbf{threads synchronization APIs}.

The \textbf{scheduler} is in charge of selecting a running thread among all
available threads in the system; the implemented algorithm is a priority list
without pre-emption or substitution.
The running thread is the highest priority thread in ready state, not blocked nor 
waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
Task switching \textit{must not} happen in interrupt context, and no interrupt
routine is allowed to call any scheduler function; doing so will surely result in
a memory corruption.
The \textbf{scheduler} algorithm is implementing a cooperative model: the
running thread will not be substituted until the code in execution \textit{voluntary}
suspends the thread, or put it in a wait state for I/O or waiting for a mutex, a
semaphore, a barrier or an event; once the running thread has changed state, the
\textbf{scheduler} will select another thread to become the running one.

The scheduler follows a strict priority selection, so the running thread will never
switch to a \footnote{Not yelding for lower priority threads is a policy.} lower
priority thread.
A specific kernel API allows suspension only in case at least one higher
priority thread is ready.

When no threads are running, the scheduler will fall back to the \textbf{idle
thread}; this is a special thread used to occupy the processor when there is no
specific task to be completed.
The \textbf{idle thread} performs some accounting and --- most important above
all --- calls a power saving function, part of the Hardware Abstraction Layer
and to be implemented for each processor; power saving is one of the most
important functionality of the kernel, as the processor will spare power, save
batteries, and require less cooling.

The \textbf{system clock manager} is a sensitive piece of code dealing with
the system clock and the system timings in general.
It will initialize the clock device\footnote{Version 1.0 of DiegOS supports
one clock source only \texttt{/dev/clk0}} and perform accounting of system
ticks\footnote{System ticks are implemented as a monotonic fixed rate counter},
system wall clock\footnote{The system clock accounts milliseconds since boot time}
and the clock period.
The clock period is dynamic, hence \textbf{DiegOS} use a tickless kernel.

The \textbf{kernel interface} is the public interface used by application code
to interact with the management of threads, with the system startup and
shutdown, and with system devices.
This interface allow applications to create and destroy a thread, suspend it
and make it sleep for a specific amount of time, and access hardware through
devices.
The true nature of this interface is not hiding thread management, but rather
hiding \textit{scheduling} operations, preventing applications from accessing
any of the \textbf{scheduler} functions.
As a matter of fact, in \textbf{DiegOS} the scheduler is a hidden layer and is
accessible  only through the \textbf{kernel interface}.
Also hardware and drivers are hidden by this layer, they are accessible by
using the \textit{devices} interface which is an abstraction of the drivers
interface.

The final item is the collection of \textbf{thread synchronization APIs};
since the scheduler and the threads management are hidden layers, the applications 
have no direct access to each other nor can communicate directly with each
other.
Applications need to synchronize when they share data, objects, files, or when
they need to observe a timeline --- so they need to synchronize with the
system clock.
\textbf{DiegOS} implement mutexes, barriers, spin locks, timers and alarms.
Additionally, an API for event management is provided to let threads talk to
each other without crossing function calls or sharing global data.

\subsection{Layer 1a: The drivers}
\textbf{Drivers} are a very important part of the kernel, they are allowed to access
internals of the kernel \textit{not} exposed to applications, and usually
implement \textit{interrupt routines} which requires access to sensitive
resources offered by the processor or the platform or the kernel itself.
Being dedicated to manage hardware it is not possible to implement a single
common interface for all \textbf{drivers}, at the same time, a lot of functions and
data and logic are common among all \textbf{drivers}.
\textbf{DiegOS} interfaces have been conceived to share (to inherit) a common
set of properties, adding specializations when needed.

\subsection{Layer 2: The libraries}
\textbf{Libraries} are the core of any software infrastructure.
Algorithms and data structures are stored in libraries to share knowledge,
make their implementations common and available to applications, the kernel,
the drivers, anyone.
Niklaus Wirth back in 1976 published a book titled \emph{"Algorithms + Data
Structures = Programs"} creating a milestone for software engineering: data
structures and algorithms are indipendent yet interlocked, as data structures
are owned by the running application, but the strategy to use them at best
is common.

There are two places for \textbf{libraries} in \textbf{DiegOS}, the user
applications libraries and the kernel libraries. The difference between the
two can be found in the target they accomplish: applications need general
purpose data to solve general purpose problems, so they need lists, queues,
binary trees, and some strategies to use them at best, like sorting or
searching.
On the other hand the kernel code need specific data to handle drivers, manage
hardware, communications busses, interrupt controllers, but again with common
strategies like enumeration or sorting.

One noticeable detail in \textbf{DiegOS} is the presence of the \texttt{libc}
library as native source code in place of the several implementations
available.\footnote{At the time of this writing well-known \texttt{libc}
implementations are \texttt{glibc}, \texttt{uClibc}, \texttt{musl} and the
\texttt{C runtime Library (CRT)}.} This singularity needs some explanation.
As mentioned several times now this Operating System is a hobby not for
production; porting a library to a new Operating System is a big effort,
expecially considering the \texttt{libc} contents. Writing a new dedicated
version proved to be effective and required an effort compatible with spending
some nights awake --- rather than burning lots of midnight oil.

Kernel libraries offer support for handling the PCI bus, some timing facility,
and interfaces to the file system.
Application libraries offer support for red\&black trees, lists, queues, hashed
lists, memory pools, chunk managers, dynamic vectors, circual buffers, stacks,
and many other.

\subsection{Layer 3: The applications}
\textbf{Applications} are the top level layer in \textbf{DiegOS} and they are
barely noticeable in the code base, users are expected to add whatever they 
want to this layer, customizing the system experience.
An \textit{application} is not self-contained as it is supposed to be, as the
overall system is a single binary; applications are prevented from accessing
the internals of the kernel and are allowed to use only public APIs as found
in libraries.
Applications code run inside threads, at least one must be spawned at the end
of the kernel initialization by declaring the function \texttt{platform\_run()}
which is responsible for initializing data and threads.
While one binary can run several applications, only one
\texttt{platform\_run()} function can be declared: this means that applications
can be spread over a number of files, but the entry point is common and is
inside \texttt{platform\_run()}.

\section{Portability}
The source code of \textbf{DiegOS} is written in plain C, with a little amount of
assembler to perform hardware init.
The C language is a compulsory choice when portability is a priority, and
along with it the speed of the resulting binary.
Assembler is not required apart for initializations and to access specific
instructions not known to the compiler; it can be handful when it is desidered to 
add hard optimizations to some function or even a whole API, provided that readability
of the code is kept to a level where any developer could read the code,
read the comments, understand the algorithm, the pitfalls, and the possible C counterpart.
\footnote{Assembler is never portable, but can be translated if understandable}

Some drivers and some libraries' API do have a double personality, one implementation
in plain C and one implementation optimized in assembler; the former is totally portable,
the latter is welcome when performance gets on stage.
The system is not designed to run on 64-bit architectures, writing 32- and 64-bit compliant 
code requires considerable time (and time is a scarce resource!).
\footnote{Writing code able to compile and run on both 32- and 64-bit processors would break
the rule of simplicity; still, you will find computations and arrangements to
support 64-bit systems.}
The system supports compiling and linking source files written in C++ using
classes and objects, this makes it possibile to write applications with
\textit{Object Oriented Programming}. It was not foreseen to add objects to
the kernel, although possible, it would require a new architecture.

The system can be easily ported to different platforms or can support several
new devices making use of its driver infrastructure and the minimal
\textit{HAL} required to support a board.

\section{build system}
The code base of DiegOS builds using makefiles and the make tool, no ancillary
tool is required apart for a C-language toolchain.
Any toolchain can be deployed and used to compile and build \textbf{DiegOS},
at the time of this writing only GCC has been tested.

Output object files are stored in dedicated directories named after the platform 
and CPU configured for the specific build.
Due to this choice it is possible to build several binary images in the same workspace without generating
conflicts.
It is also easier to add platform specific optimizations inside general purpose modules as all makefiles
are aware of the platform and CPU options.
The makefiles \textit{will not} automatically perform a selection of source
code using platform and CPU as a key, this excercise is left to the
developers.

Configuration of the build system is implemented with makefiles again, so
there is no need to use other tools rather than \textit{make}.
This choice implies passing the configuration to the compiling toolchain as
command line strings, and this poses a limit to the size of the configuration as
the length of the command line is also the length of all declarations and
strings passed to the compiler.
Again, while there are smarter solutions, this is a simple one and will not let the
system become too complex.

\chapter{System}
The kernel, the libraries, the applications, they are all parts of a whole
system. A system with a well defined target: start applications and make them
run in a steady environment.
To this purpose some additional sections are required in \textbf{DiegOS}, the
boot code to let the main binary run in a preconfigured hardware environment,
the file system to store and retrieve data, the networking subsystem to
connect to the outer world.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{kernel_handsketched}
\end{figure}

\section{The boot code}
The boot code belongs to the booting stage and it's ultimate goal is to
implement the most straighforward solution to setup the processor, the CPU
peripherals, and then load and run the \textbf{DiegOS} binary.
Boot code should be adaptable to any platform and any medium,
and it should perform using the least amount of interactions with the hardware.
It is understood that boot code is essentially processor and platform dependent,
even reducing the assembler parts to the bare minimum there would be a huge
portion of operations which vary with the machine.

There is an elegant and effective solution to the problem of mixing
dependencies with abstract algorithms, that is the \textit{Hardware
Abstraction Layer}; in \textbf{DiegOS} most of the booting process is
implemented into \textit{HAL} functions, so that a very thin layer of
high-level functions can perform common steps indipendently from the
underlying hardware.

To satisfy these requirements \textbf{DiegOS} is built as a raw binary, relocated
to start at a specific memory address --- the same that will be used to 
load it and then run it.\footnote{At the time of this writing there is no support
for COFF, ELF or PE formats.}

It is suggested to always build an ELF file along with the raw binary, 
to satisfy the needs of having a symbol reference for debugging, along with
all binutils capabilities.
In case the target EABI does not support the ELF format, any other object file
format can be used; just be aware you always need to emit a raw binary file to
load and execute \textbf{DiegOS}.

Coming to procedures, the boot code implements a detailed setup procedure to have consistent 
booting steps across any platform.
This procedure is described in the following bullets.
Please note the recommendations on how to write and document the code: any detail counts in this stage.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Setup the host processor in order to be able to execute the boot code.
Reserve a register or a memory location to store debugging data like return 
values or failures, it can be very handy even if a debugger is available as
this stage comes so early in the booting process that understanding the
easiest issue might be really hard.
Add comments to explain how this data can be used. Do not add debugging
infrastructures, traces, endless strings for printouts.
\item Access the medium where you stored the \textbf{DiegOS} binary, and read it into
memory. Document where the binary is put in memory, why it is put there, and
the memory layout during boot. The medium and the code required to
access it are up to you. The rationale here is, split your boot code if it grows beyond
logic; chain booting is not an option in this case.
\item Before jumping to the OS entry point go through this checklist:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item All registers must be setup to start \textbf{DiegOS}: scratch registers should be
    set to null, memory registers should be set to access the whole addressing
    space; you could also restrict the range of available addresses, but you 
    must ensure the OS is still able to access all the memory and all the hardware.
    \item A small stack will be used by the system init stage, be sure to set
    it up before jumping or you'll crash the machine.
    \item All interrupts \textit{must be disabled} prior to jumping to the
    \textbf{DiegOS} entry point. 
    \end{enumerate}

\item Jump to the system entry point, which is labelled as \texttt{DiegOS}.
Be careful not to perform a function call, but simply jump to the label;
calling implies using the stack, and setting a return address somewhere, which
is not expected to happen.\footnote{No Operating System returns to the boot
code after shutting down.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{System initialization}
Initialization is split into a set of function calls, acting on both hardware and
software. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Initialize the uninitialized data memory space, the .BSS section in
ELF format terminology.
\item Initialize the processor, including power save features, interrupts,
cache memory.
\item Initialize the platform hardware and software; usually you would init
heap and SoC devices here, as well as platform-dependent libraries (i.e.
malloc).
\textbf{Do not initialize} any kind of driver at this stage.
\item Initialize the TTY; depending on your platform, this can be a frame buffer,
a video card, a serial line; keep in mind that this is the system's TTY, and will be used
for debugging purposes only.
\item Initialize the drivers; details about the drivers infrastructure are
explained in section \ref{sub:drivers} at page \pageref{sub:drivers}
\item Initialize the kernel
\item Enable all interrupts
\item Initialize the users' additions, threads added to perform specific tasks
at user's will.
\item Run the kernel, this actually roll the ball and kicks the scheduler.
\end{itemize}

\section{The kernel}
The core functionalities of DiegOS are enclosed in this library.
The kernel is a single instance, single processor component; it does not
support any kind of memory protection, and it is expecting to be able to access the
whole address space with no restrictions. As mentioned before, there could be restrictions
on the address space, but the OS must still be able to drive all the hardware and must
be able to access all the memory.
The kernel does not support threads contention or access privilege, so any portion of
the code (and consequently any thread) is able to peek or poke any memory location or 
access any hardware device.
This is questionable choice, although it is nothing the God of Information wouldn't let you in 
heaven for \\footnote{you can guess where the citation comes from ...}.
All in all, a general purpose OS would not even mention memory protection as an option; 
again, if you need the real thing, go get it. A small bare-metal system would require lots
of resources to assure a decent level of security if implementing memory protection,
and this is not a goal for DiegOS.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{kernel_handsketched}
\end{figure}

\section{Kernel services}
The kernel offers the following services: a thread scheduler, a thread management API, 
an alarm API, events queueing and dispatching, mutexes, barriers, I/O waiting and spin locks.\\
Alarms, Events and Mutexes are all managed services, meaning that an owning thread
can create, destroy, or reconfigure them at any time.

\begin{description}
\item[The Scheduler] the DiegOS scheduler is as simple as possible, and is implemented as a FIFO
queue with several priority levels. Pre-emption is not supported, and threads must co-operate in
 order to give up CPU time when computing is not required.

Threads can be suspended, halted, delayed, and removed\footnote{Removal means the
thread will be killed.} but at least one thread must be ready to run at any time
\footnote{This is the Idle thread, which cannot be killed.}.

The scheduler is designed to manage the threads' finite state machine and select 
the running thread by using a priority queue schema. There are four
priorities in DiegOS, namely \texttt{Idle Priority}, \texttt{Normal Priority}, 
\texttt{High Priority} and \texttt{Realtime Priority}.

When a thread is in the ready queue, it will not substitute the running
one, not even if the ready thread's priority is higher; pre-emption is \textbf{not
supported} at all.
The running thread must give up by suspending or waiting on some shared resource to let
the scheduler select another running thread.

The scheduler will loop the highest priority queue with at least a ready thread until the
list is void; the list will be empty when all the threads with that priority have suspended or have
been killed.
This implies that all threads in a specific ready queue will run at least once before being evicted
from the list itself.
Lists are browsed in decreasing priority order down to \texttt{Idle priority} where at least one ever-running
thread is expected to exists.

Whatever the thread's priority might be, a thread owns the system until suspending or waiting: care must be taken
in writing application code processing data to avoid hogging the CPU or - definitively worser - starving other
threads.

Bear in mind that a higher priority thread will never give up for a lower priority
thread; to avoid CPU hogging you must be sure that all threads will either sleep or 
wait or delay, and they should perform their processing as fast as possible;
if you cannot complete the required actions in a decent amount of time, you must split
operations and run them in chunks, suspending the thread between runs;
failing to do so will starve all threads exept the running one.
Even if this might be a desired behavior, it is really dangerous and might generate unwanted effects
on accounting or performance monitoring.

\item[Threads] a thread is a new independent code path starting from a
function (used as entry point) that can be alternated with other code paths.
Whenever a thread hands over to another thread, the kernel has to store the
CPU's context into the running thread, and restore the context loading it from
the handed over thread.
Context is defined as the set of registers and flags that differ from path to
path in the code.\\
Along with the processor context a distinctive feature of a thread is its \textbf{stack}.
The stack pointer (which is usually part of the processor context) must be saved and restored
and stack memory areas \textbf{must not} be corrupted at any time, or the distinctive backtrace of 
code paths would break leading to memory corruptions or crashes.

Threads can be in four stable states, namely \texttt{RUN, WAIT, SLEEP,  READY}, and two transient states
 \texttt{IDLE} and \texttt{KILL}.
The latter are transient by definition as they designate a thread which has been created but never run (\texttt{IDLE})
and a thread scheduled to be killed (\texttt{KILL})
\footnote{A thread is not killed upon call to a specific kernel interface, it is inserted in a temporary queue for later disposal.}.\\
Threads can be promoted from the \texttt{READY} state to the \texttt{RUN} state  by the scheduler internals only;  the reverse action is performed by \textit{suspension} function calls.\\
Kernel APIs can change the \texttt{RUN} thread state to \texttt{WAIT} state by means of \textit{sleeping} functions or \textit{suspension points}.
\footnote{Kernel suspension points are mutexes, barriers, I/O waits.}

\item[Alarms] are a fundamental feature to let threads sleep and wake up at a
defined time. 
Alarms are events queued to a thread with a specific class ID; handling alarms is just
like handling events. Alarms can be one-shot or recursive, and can be started or
halted anytime.
\item[Events] are extensible system messages, used to signal some interesting news to a thread. 
Events are organized as queues (FIFO), and processed one by one in
chronological order.\\
Memory management for events is optional,  both the producer and the
consumer must take care of allocating memory when creating an event message,
and freeing it once the event has been processed. The producer can create events
with no memory-free handler, in this case the consumer will not release the event storage;
if a memory-free handler is set, the consumer will invoke it passing a pointer to the event
as a parameter to the handler.\\
\textbf{Important:} the memory release handler (memory-free handler) is executed in
the \textit{consumer} thread's context, possibly out of control of the producer's thread;
if events are created on the heap a synchronization mechanism must be put in place to
avoid corrupting data structures.
\item[Mutexes] are the simplest form of semaphore. A mutex is initially
unlocked; the first thread trying to acquire a lock on the mutex will actually get the lock
and proceed with execution, entering a critical code section and running as long as it needs to.
Unless the mutex is unlocked, no other thread is allowed to enter the same
critical code section; other threads trying to acquire a lock on the same mutex will sit in a
waiting queue. 
Once the first thread has released (unlocked) the mutex, the threads waiting for 
a lock will be run one at a time, until no waiting threads are left; every thread entering the
critical section is guaranteed to have acquired a lock on the mutex, which means, 
code after the lock acquisition function is guaranteed to run helding a lock on the mutex.\\
Once no thread is waiting for a lock on the mutex, the mutex is left unlocked.
\item[Spin locks] are a running  atomic delay to acquire a lock on a integer used as a
barrie. Spin locks can be locked or unlocked.\\
A thread trying to acquire a spin lock will enter an infinite loop until the lock is 
gained, so if the spin lock is originally locked, the thread will suspend and enter
the ready queue continuosly.\\
Good use of spin locks is to protect very short critical sections or hardware accesses,
where the longer code path required to manage mutexes might be not as efficient.
\item[I/O waits] are wait queues, useful to suspend the calling thread execution till 
data is available, this usually happens while waiting for input from a hardware device.\\
The suspended thread is removed from the ready queue and parked into a wait queue, multiple
threads can sleep on the same wait queue, and can be awakened in groups.\\
Threads are moved from wait queues to ready queues in a FIFO fashion, and it is not possible
to priorize or sort this sequence.
\item[Barriers] are a form of cumulative mutual exclusion, useful to suspend execution of several
threads waiting for a single shared resource to be available.\\
Barriers are \textit{closed} upon creation, and can be opened or closed by any thread; an open barrier will
resume \textbf{all} the waiting threads at once moving them into their respective \textit{ready queues}.\\
Optionally a barrier can automatically close after opening, creating a step-lock software gate.

\section{Drivers}
\label{sub:drivers}
Drivers in DiegOS are interfaces to hardware.
They enable software to start and stop hardware operations, configure it, and perform input and output.
Common operations performed by drivers include enabling and handling interrupts: the pertinent code must
be carefully designed to avoid conflicts with the system-wide interrupt handling.
DiegOS protects critical sections by enabling and disabling interrupts, and these operations \textbf{are not}
designed to be reentrant.
The system-wide interrupt handler will invoke the registered callback with the corresponding interrupt \textbf{off},
and will enable the interrupt back again once the servicing routine returns.

There is a common interface for all drivers, and common rules to specify functions.\\
All functions returning a status will return an \texttt{int} value.\\
All functions returning a size will return an \texttt{unsigned int} value.\\
Drivers are multi-instance, as a consequence all function prototypes must specify an \texttt{unsigned int} unit number
as last parameter.

The \texttt{init} function can be used to initialize the driver for a specific instance
\footnote{An instance matches a hardware device, a single driver can handle multiple devices.}
but \texttt{not} actually make the device run.

Functions \texttt{start} and \texttt{stop} can run the hardware activities or stop them, this includes enabling or disabling
interrupts, DMA transfers, I/O operations, sensors polling, and so on.
It is assumed that alternating calls to \texttt{start} and \texttt{stop} will make the hardware device either work or not work,
but will not change its configuration or power state.

Function \texttt{done} can be used to terminate the driver and shut down the hardware device. This operation is \textbf{not reversible}
in contrast with the \texttt{start} and \texttt{stop} functions. Once \texttt{done} has been invoked it is required to call \texttt{init} again
to reset the device to defaults and reconfigure it.

Function \texttt{status} can be called at any time to report the driver's internal state, the ongoing operation, and the driver's specialization
\footnote{Drivers have different extensions for different kind of hardware devices: block devices, character devices, graphics, networking}.

\section{Libraries}

Every operating  environment offers a set of libraries to be used
at application level.
Applications make use of widely known data structures and algorithms
to build even more complex algorithms.
When an Operating System is built as a single process, running application
level threads, the availability of such APIs enable developers to code
highly orthogonal systems, leveraging on the same libraries for drivers,
front ends, interfaces, databases, applications.

DiegOS offers a pletora of data structures

\subsection{Recommendations and other suggestions}
The core functionalities are very simple: spawn a number of execution threads, run all
of them one by one, interrupts \textbf{cannot and must not} invoke a context switch,
synchronize the execution by suspension, share resources with mutexes or spinlocks.

A few words about mutexes and spinlocks and their pros and cons: mutexes have a more complex
code path and disable or enable interrupts to avoid contention within the scheduler, while
spinlocks are very light and simple.
On reverse, a thread waiting to acquire a lock on a mutex will enter a wait queue, thus it will
sit and wait (and shut up!) until its time has come to run and gain a lock; a thread waiting to
acquire a lock on a spinlock will continuosly suspend and thus will be rescheduled until its
time has come to gain a lock.

The balance is, more complexity but lesser CPU usage, opposed to extreme simplicity but a busy CPU.
My suggestion is to use spinlocks for very fast and short critical sections, whereas managing mutexes
would be worser and slower; make use of mutexes if you need heavy computations inside the critical 
section, as all other contending thread will be waiting and won't be scheduled at all, freeing up the 
CPU and letting the locking thread complete its tasks as fast as possible.
